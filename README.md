### Description

by "Package & Deployment Wizard", that follows with VB (I think will all versions).___

What it does is it edits the setup.lst file, that controls the whole setup process. There is a few functions that you can't do in the standard setup creator.___

---NEW---

Well I have updated this, so now almost every function works (even though few dosn't have many functions).

But now you can actualy use it as a program, it supports so much that it's great for you'r setup projects.

I have added some new utilities, a great date editor, to make it all look a little more pro.
