*** This program isn't finished yet, still some features
missing ***

For testing, make a copy of a project, and copy it into
a folder, just a security backup (not that this cam harm
the file, but you might make some adjustments, you don't
want to)

I will keep posting updates, as I make progress.


--- NEXT VERSION ---

 * I will have a help file in the next version.

Then in the version after that the following:

 * Better code (if I feel like rewriting some of the bad)
 * The date utility can detect more
 * Of course I will try finding and correcting errors
 * Maybe I will do some work on the analyse utility
 * I will add the group editor
